Additionally, the UMB observatory provides the <code>umbtest</code> library which is where we put our unit tests. This observatory is provided as a Docker container. <h2>What's included</h2> The docker container has the following elements: <ol><li>Storm with preliminary UMB support, taken from <a href="https://github.com/tquatmann/storm/tree/io/binaryformat">Tim Quatmann's fork</a> (UMB support has yet to be merged into the main Storm repo).</li> <li>PRISM (on the <code>umb</code> branch).</li> <li><code>umbi</code> as available on PyPI.</li> <li>The <code>umbitest</code> library.</li> <li>A Jupyter notebook, bound to port 8000.</li></ol> You can either build the Docker image yourself from <a href="https://github.com/pmc-tools/umb-observatory">the GitHub repository</a> or you can pull it from <a href="https://ghcr.io/pmc-tools/docker">ghcr.io</a>: <div class="code">docker pull ghcr.io/pmc-tools/docker:main</div> Once the image is pulled, simply run it, making sure you bind port 8000, otherwise the Jupyter notebook will not be accessible. <div class="code">docker run --name pmcdocker -d -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/pmc-tools/docker:main</div> If you are, for whatever reason, already using that port, you may bind, i.e., port 8001 with <code>-p 8001:8000</code>.</div>`);function c(o){var e=i();r(o,e)}export{c as component};
