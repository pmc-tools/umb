Developed in Dagstuhl, Saarland by a panel of field experts, it is an open standard, with a reference implementation, <a href="umbi">UMBI</a>, and is compatible with many probabilistic model checking tools.</p> <p>Because UMB is explicit, rather than abstract, it is a "compiled" model. It contains all states, nondeterministic actions, probabilistic branches, and labels in a manner that can simply be read into a tool, as opposed to parsing and building the state space from an abstract representation, like PRISM or JANI. This format does not replace PRISM or JANI, but supplements it.</p> <blockquote><p>Three PRISM files for the probabalistic model checkers under the sky,<br/> Seven for the <code>.tra</code>-parsers in their halls of stone,<br/> Nine JANI files for PhD students doomed to die,<br/> One format for the Dark Lord on his dark throne<br/> In the Land of Dagstuhl where the shadows lie.<br/> One format to rule them all, one format to find them,<br/> One standard to bring them all and in compatibility bind them<br/> In the Land of Saarland where the shadows lie.</p></blockquote> <h3>UMB is supported by many tools:</h3> <!></div>',1);function B(t){var e=k(),o=f(e);g(o);var a=r(o,2),i=r(d(a),10);y(i),p(a),s(t,e)}export{B as component};
